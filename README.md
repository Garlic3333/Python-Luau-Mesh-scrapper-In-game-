# Python-Luau-Mesh-scrapper-In-game-
Simple Python server using flask, waitress, and the Luau (ROBLOX) scrapper of the game-mesh, its a local plugin, i guess its all of i can tell, simple 2 use, check README 






So before 2 use it, u neeed to get a your ipconfig ( Simple IPv4 ) and change 0.0.0.0 to your IPv4 
First we need to start a our server in python
Second to upload our Luau code as local plugin, dont forget to change in Luau your config
and there, feel free 2 use it

(P.s you need to change every time your IPv4 when you reload pc, they cant host your server normally so be safe )
